# PDF Export Feature Design

## Goal

Add a "Save report" button to the Recommendations page that exports a full evaluation report as a PDF.

## Approach

Client-side PDF generation using **jsPDF** (programmatic construction). No server changes required.

## PDF Content

The report includes all evaluation data except persona inner monologues:

**Page 1 — Header & Assessment**
1. Deckster logo text + "Evaluation Report" title
2. Presentation goal
3. Success score — percentage + label (e.g., "72% — Good chance")
4. Overall summary paragraph
5. Strengths (bullet list) and Weaknesses (bullet list)

**Page 1-2 — Persona Feedback**
6. Section header: "Panel Feedback"
7. Per persona: name, title, category, decision sentiment (color-coded), decision text, core points (bullets)

**Page 2-3 — Recommendations**
8. Section header: "Recommendations"
9. Main advice block
10. Numbered recommendations with: title, priority badge, description, "Why?" rationale, related persona names

**Footer** on every page: "Generated by Deckster Evaluator — {date}" + page number

## Architecture

- **New file**: `client/src/services/pdfExport.ts` — pure function, takes typed data, triggers PDF download
- **Props change**: `Recommendations` component receives additional props: `evaluations`, `overallSummary`, `goal`
- **App.tsx change**: Pass `evaluations`, `overallSummary`, `goal` to `Recommendations`
- **Button**: "Save report" ghost button in Recommendations header bar, next to "Start over"
- **Dependency**: `jspdf` added to client package

## Decisions

- **No inner monologue** in PDF — keeps report concise (2-4 pages)
- **Client-side only** — no server changes, no Puppeteer
- **jsPDF programmatic** — lightweight, full layout control, no DOM dependency
- **Decoupled from React** — export function is a pure service, testable independently
